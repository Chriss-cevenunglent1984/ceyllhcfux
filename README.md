OMG, just watched Ask Sadece Bir An and I'm like... WHAT even just happened?! It's like my brain is full of sleepy, romantic fluff right now. You ever watch a movie and it just leaves you feeling all swirly, but in a good way? I mean, seriously! The plot was all over the place, but in a way that's kinda charming, you know what I mean? There was this really sweet scene where they cooked togetherâ€”made me wanna grab a spatula and get my fry on in the kitchen, HA! But, who am I kidding? I'm too tired to even start the rice cooker right now. ðŸ˜‚

Anyhoo, the characters were simultaneously frustrating and kinda lovable. Did you get a chance to download the movie by any chance? I feel like the dialogue sometimes was like, what? But then you just roll with it because of their expressions. The leads have that kind of chemistry that makes you a little jealous but also makes you root for them. It's that whole will they, won't they thing again and I'm like screaming JUST KISS ALREADY. It's infuriating but addictive!

> Ugh, you know when you get to the end and you're half happy and half, wait, that's it? I can't decide if I want to watch the movie again or if I'm too emotionally exhausted lol. It's like a food coma but for your feels. They should make that a thing, seriously! But the soundtrack was like a surprise comforter for your ears. Such a mood.

Totally got distractedâ€”how did we end up talking about this movie in the first place? ðŸ¤” Anyway, point is, def check it out if you haven't. Itâ€™s such a gem of ridiculous but lovely moments. Hope it leaves you feeling as delightfully confused as I am right now lol.
